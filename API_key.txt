///////////////////////////////
there are 3 main methods for this service

/checkout
     - Receives POST data and inserts into Sprredly and Airtable
/checkout/add
    - Adds new items to Order via POSt
/checkout/charge
    - Creates a charge for total amount of order to stored payment from step 1


//////////////////////////////
so just to quickly go over it
> /checkout captures that data from form POST

> Card is stored in Spreedly and payment token gets returned then we store this in Airtable as a Payments record

> Customer, Order with Authorized status and Order items are created in Airtable

> When user is in an upsell step and calls /checkout/add then more items get added to the order

> When we call /checkout/charge then the total of order sum in the specified currency gets charged using Spreedly and the returned token that was stored in Airtable

> Customer and Order gets inserted in Shopify when all is confirmed and changed Status to Order in Airtable to Paid in the Order item from Authorized
